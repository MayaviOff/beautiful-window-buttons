# Extension for Creating Beautiful Window Control Buttons

## Why do you need it?

I made this extension 'cuz I can't change application theme in GNOME 48 â€” especially window control buttons ðŸ˜”  
If you have the same problems â€” you're very welcome!

## What can you do using this extension?

This extension was made for creating beautiful window control buttons.  
Using this extension, you can change the **color** of all 3 control buttons.

## What will I do in the future?

In future, I'll add these features:

- Creating buttons of different shapes  
- Choosing custom colors for your buttons  
- Choosing the position of buttons  
- Saving your layout to a JSON file to use on another PC  
- Maybe something else!

## How to install

You can install it via gnome-shell-extensions, Extension manager or in manual way.

### Manual Way

You can install extension by following this simple steps:

1. Clone the repo from github  
`git clone https://github.com/MayaviOff/beautiful-window-buttons ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`
2. Restart gnome shell (best way - reboot)
3. Activate extension:  
`gnome-extensions enable beautiful-window-buttons@mayavi`

If it doesn't work i recommend u to install this stuff using Gnome Extensions Manager

## Little Conclusion

I hope that nobody will have the same problems I did,  
but if you do â€” I hope this extension helps you ðŸ˜Š
